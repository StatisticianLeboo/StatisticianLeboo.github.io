<p>We use RBD experiments when the whole experimental area is not homogeneous. Variability is controlled by grouping the experimental area into relatively homogeneous groups known as blocks. Treatments are set into these blocks randomly and thus their means will give rise to unbiased estimates of the treatment effect.</p>
