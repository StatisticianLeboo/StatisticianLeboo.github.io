## Introduction
CRD are basic experiments run using ANOVA techniques. This Section discusses how to perform them in R.
Find the dataset below;
https://github.com/StatisticianLeboo/statistics-topics/tree/ANOVA

## CRD 
## Example 1
The data contains 4 tropical food stuffs A, B, C, and D tried on 20 chicks. Analyze the data at 5% level of significance.
```{r}
library(readxl)
chicks <- read_excel("chics.xlsx")
```

Set the treatment column into factors
```{r}
chicks$Treatment<-as.factor(chicks$Treatment)
```
Performing ANOVA
## Method 1
```{r}
mod1<-aov(Weight~Treatment, data = chicks)
summary(mod1)
```

## Method 2
```{r}
chicksmodel<-lm(Weight~Treatment, data = chicks)
anova(chicksmodel)
```
## LSD Test
```{r}
library(agricolae)
LSD.test(chicksmodel,"Treatment", console = TRUE)
```
## Example 2
The data contains the amount of electricity used in KWh in three towns. Test at 5% significance whether the amount of electricity used is the same in the 3 towns.
The steps are as example 1

```{r}
library(readxl)
electricity <- read_excel("electricity.xlsx")

#Set the treatment variable to factor
electricity$Town<-as.factor(electricity$Town)
model2<-aov(Electricity_Used~Town, data=electricity)
summary(model2)
```
